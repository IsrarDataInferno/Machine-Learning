00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,180
So far we introduce quite a few notions about regressions.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,350
Most statistics books start by introducing regression assumptions directly but we prefer to talk about

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:17,210
the intuition behind regressions first and then introduce you to regression assumptions.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,350
Now that we have seen quite a few lessons we are ready to introduce regression assumptions here.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,520
We divide them into five assumptions.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,420
You should know all of them and consider them before you perform regression analysis.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,080
We will have a separate lesson for each one.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,550
The first one is linearity.

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,050
It is called a linear regression.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,960
As we said earlier there are other types of regressions with more sophisticated models.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,300
The linear regression is the simplest one and assumes linearity.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:58,330
Each independent variable is multiplied by a coefficient and summed up to predict the value.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,980
The second one is endogenously of regressors.

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:08,920
Mathematically this is expressed as the covariance of the error and the x' is zero for any error or

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,900
x.

16
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:16,700
The third assumption is normality and homeless get asked this city of the error term normality means

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,550
the error term is normally distributed.

18
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:26,230
The expected value of the error is zero as we expect to have no errors on average homo.

19
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,310
Good ass density.

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,550
In plain English means constant variance.

21
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,100
We will discuss it thoroughly later.

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,330
The fourth assumption is no autocorrelation.

23
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:42,790
Mathematically the covariance of any two error terms is zero.

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,770
That's the assumption that would usually stop you from using a linear regression in your analysis and

25
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:56,000
the last one is no multi-collinearity multi-collinearity is observed when two or more variables have

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,270
a high correlation between each other OK.

27
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,380
These are the main regression assumptions.

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,520
They are crucial for regression analysis as the purpose of this section is to help you understand regressions.

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,410
You should not skip any lectures about assumptions at your workplace.

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,680
The biggest mistake you can make is to perform a regression that violates one of these assumptions.
