# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Collection

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository!  
This repo contains a collection of projects, experiments, and notebooks that I’ve built while learning and practicing **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI concepts**.

Each folder in this repository represents a **complete mini-project** focused on one ML concept — from simple regression models to advanced algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

- Learn and implement **core ML algorithms** step-by-step.  
- Build practical intuition by working on **real and synthetic datasets**.  
- Improve understanding of **data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation**.  
- Create a portfolio of **machine learning projects** to demonstrate progress and skills.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

This repository will gradually include projects on:

| Category | Algorithms / Topics | Description |
|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Regression** | Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, Polynomial Regression | Predicting continuous outcomes like prices or scores |
| **Classification** | Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM | Predicting categories such as pass/fail, yes/no |
| **Clustering** | K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering | Grouping data points without labels |
| **Dimensionality Reduction** | PCA, LDA | Reducing feature dimensions while keeping key information |
| **Model Evaluation** | Cross-validation, Metrics (MSE, R², Accuracy, etc.) | Measuring model performance |
| **Feature Engineering** | Normalization, Encoding, Feature Selection | Preparing data for better model performance |
| **Advanced Topics** | Neural Networks, NLP, Time Series | (To be added later as learning progresses) |
