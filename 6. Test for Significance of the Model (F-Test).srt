00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,300
One of the measures we haven't spoken about so far is the F statistic.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,950
Let's try to explain its essence and see how it can be useful to us.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,670
Much like the Z statistic that follows a normal distribution and the t statistic that follows a Student's

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,140
t distribution.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,840
The F statistic follows an F distribution.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm calling it a statistic so it is used for a test drive.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,270
You guessed correctly the test is known as the test for overall significance of the model.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,550
The null hypothesis is all the betas are equal to zero simultaneously.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,630
The alternative hypothesis is at least one Bayda defers from zero.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,690
What's the interpretation If all data is zero then none of the independent variables matter.

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,220
Therefore our model has no merit.

12
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,530
Let's see the regression summary from the S.A.T. GPA lecture.

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,600
The F statistic is fifty six point zero five.

14
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,750
The cell below is its p value.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,470
The number is really low.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,740
It has virtually zero point zero zero zero.

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,060
We see the overall model is significant.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,250
The F-test is important for regressions as it gives us some important insights.

19
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,370
Let's see the table for the model where we added the random 1 to 3 variable that had nothing to do with

20
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,480
anything.

21
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:35,240
The statistic is twenty seven point seven six and the p value is zero point zero zero zero.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,120
You can see the statistic is lower.

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,540
The model is still significant but less so the lower the statistic the closer to a non-significant model.

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,100
This is yet another tool that allows us to compare models OK.

25
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,810
That was the test for overall significance of the model.

26
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,670
Don't forget to look for the three zeros after the dot.

27
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,050
And thanks for watching.
